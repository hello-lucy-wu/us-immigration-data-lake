# U.S. Immigration Data Lake
### Data Engineering Project

According to the Gallup World Poll survey(2013-2016), the United States is one of the top desired destinations for potential migrants to move. Around 147 millions of people who participated in the survey worldwide would like to immigrate to the U.S. This project is to create a data lake to help people know more about the country demographics. In addition, the officers, who inspect and examine passengers at U.S. ports of entry, are able to retrieve insights over the i94 visitor arrival/departure records.

#### Here are the datasets used to build the data lake:
* I94 Visitor Arrival/Departure Records: This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office. You can read more about it [here](https://travel.trade.gov/research/reports/i94/historical/2016.html).
* U.S. Cities Demographic Data: This data comes from OpenSoft. You can read more about it [here](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/export/).

#### Here are the insights could be retrieved from I94 records:
* Top 10 countries where visitors are from
* Top 3 busiest ports of entry
* Number of visitors arrive at U.S ports per day

#### Here are the questions might help people choose where to live:
* Which group is the racial majority of each city?

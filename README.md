# U.S. Immigration Data Lake
### Data Engineering Project

According to the Gallup World Poll survey(2013-2016), the United States is one of the top desired destinations for potential migrants to move. Around 147 millions of people who participated in the survey worldwide would like to immigrate to the U.S. This project is to create a data lake to help people know more about the country demographics. In addition, the officers, who inspect and examine passengers at U.S. ports of entry, are able to retrieve insights over the i94 visitor arrival/departure records.
